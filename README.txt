# BeliefRevision
AI project for the belief revision

To run the program open the class "Program.cs".

The belief base must be specified in a text file.
Each clause must satisfy Horn-clause restrictions and be on their own line.

The program will ask for user input indicating the name of the file. Do not write the file extension as part of the file name.
In other words: 
Valid input: test1
Not valid input: test1.txt

The incoming sentence must be given as a user input, when the program asks for it, which it does right after requesting the file name.
Example input: q|!r
